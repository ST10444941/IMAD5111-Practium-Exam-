The purpose of the app is to give the relevent information about the weeks weather, by detailing the min and the max temperatures of the week, including the average temperature. The app has 3 screens, the welcome screen, the main screen, and the Detail screen. All of which provide information on the temperature and weather of the week. 

GitHub is a favorite place for developers to collaborate; work together while sharing code; and track any changes made. It's packed with innovation to simplify teamwork and speed up the software development process. Therefore, in the following report, we are merely taking the top off the many dimensions of GitHub, the main kinds of activities that occur on it, and how individuals and teams actually use it. 
GitHub is an online platform that helps in software project version control and collaboration. In this, a developer can store his code in repositories, like folders with all files and folders of the project inside them. These repositories can either be public or privateâ€”meaning they are open to everyone or restricted to specific users. 
 
The first thing you are supposed to do with GitHub is to create a repository. Just name your project and put an optional description. You can select whether the repository is public or private, depending on your needs. 
 
Cloning is downloading a repository from GitHub to your local environment. With that, you could be able to work on the code offline and be able to make some changes that can later be pushed back to the remote repository. 
 
Commits are pretty much like snapshots in time of your project at a particular moment. Each commit holds changes made to the code, together with a short message about them. Commits serve as a way to track the history of a project, thereby making it easier to identify when and why specific changes were made. 
 
Branching is one of the most powerful features that GitHub offers. This way, developers can work on different parts of a project simultaneously and not affect or step on each other's code. Every branch represents a separate line of development such that changes in one branch can be merged into another if they are ready. 
 
A pull request is a proposed change to a repository sent by a developer. People can review, comment, and modify it repeatedly until the changes merge into the baseline; it is about requesting people to review and pull your changes into their work. Pull requests help maintain quality in code and not letting mistakes be introduced into the project. 
 
Merging means integrating changes from one branch into another. It usually happens post-pull request approval, with any necessary changes. This ensures that every developer's workspace is up-to-date with the latest codebase version. 
 
A fork is a copy of a repository in your GitHub account. This way, it is possible to alter code without altering the main project's code. Forked repositories can be utilized for experiments, bug fixes, or improvement to open-source projects. 
 
Individuals: GitHub provides a platform for individual developers to showcase their projects, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source software. It allows one to manage their code effectively, trace changes, and, above all, be able to access great resources and libraries shared by the community. Teams: GitHub helps teams coordinate their efforts, keep track of the progress being made, and manage associated tasks with much greater effectiveness. Members of a team can work on different aspects of a project at a time through pull requests and branching while safeguarding the integrity of the code. GitHub offers features like issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration with all the tools in one place, hence enabling teams to build and deploy software much more conveniently. Conclusion: This makes GitHub a significant developer and team tool, which gives a complete set of facilities that streamline the software development process from version control through project management. In this respect, with competence in version control, collaboration, and project management, GitHub offers the tool and infrastructure for building high-quality software more efficiently. With all these capabilities, one is now geared up to be more productive to deliver results. In a word, GitHub is not merely a code-repository service; it is a place of sharing that makes it an epicenter of collaboration, innovation, and continuous development in the software development world.
